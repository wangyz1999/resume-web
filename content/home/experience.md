      **Representation Learning of Robot Dynamics for Morphology Prediction**

      * Developed a multiclass-multioutput classification model that predicts the morphology of a 12-DoF quadruped robot given its dynamics â€“ multinomial time series of robot position, orientation, and joint angles. The robot's structure can be configured in countless ways.

      **Lip synchronization for Animatronic Robot Face**

      * Developed a regression model, Audio2Landmark, that accomplishes face robot natural lip-synchronization. The model learned mapping from audio signals to facial keypoints movement by watching human speech videos.
